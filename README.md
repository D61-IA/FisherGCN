# Fisher-Bures Adversary Graph Convolutional Network

This is a reference implementation of the paper [K. Sun, P. Koniusz, Z. Wang. Fisher-Bures Adversary Graph Convolutional Network. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04154)

## Outline

Based on information geometry, the intrinsic shape of the isotropic noise corresponds to the largest eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Such noise can bring a small but consistent improvement to generalization. In the paper we discussed three different geometries of a graph that is embedded in a neural network, namely intrinsic geometry (how to define graph distance); extrinsic geometry (how perturbation of the graph affect the neural network); embedding geometry (in the space of all network embeddings). We imported new tools from quantum information geometry into the domain of graph neural networks.

## Performance

The folowing table shows the average (after 20 runs) testing accuracy and testing loss on the cacnonical split the datasets, based on a GCN model with one hidden layer of size 64, learning rate 0.01, dropout rate 0.5, regularization strength 0.0005, and unified early stopping criterion.
