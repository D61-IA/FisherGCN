## Outline

Based on information geometry, the intrinsic shape of isotropic noise corresponds to the largest eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Such noise can bring a small but consistent improvement to generalization. In the paper we discussed three different geometries of a graph that is embedded in a neural network, namely intrinsic geometry (how to define graph distance); extrinsic geometry (how perturbation of the graph affect the neural network); embedding geometry (in the space of all network embeddings). We imported new tools from quantum information geometry into the domain of graph neural networks.

## Performance

The following table shows the average (20 random splits of train:dev:test data; 10 different random initialisations for each split) testing loss/accuracy, based on a GCN model with one hidden layer, using a unified early stopping criterion. One may refer to [benchmark.py](scripts/benchmark.py) for the exact evaluation protocols and hyperparameter settings.

| Model | Cora | Citeseer | Pubmed | amazon_electronics_computers | amazon_electronics_photo |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GCN |        1.103/80.21 | 1.394/69.42 | 0.836/78.33 | 2.357/37.75 | 1.998/71.03 |
| FisherGCN |  1.084/80.48 | 1.593/69.61 | 0.826/78.47 | 2.354/40.73 | 1.992/72.34 |
| GCNT |       1.076/80.96 | 1.359/70.28 | 0.793/79.02 | 2.269/68.48 | 1.938/79.4  |
| FisherGCNT | 1.045/81.21 | 1.563/70.47 | 0.782/79.12 | 2.262/70.4  | 1.928/81.12 |

Notice that the low score of GCN/FisherGCN on amazon_electronics_computer is due to failed runs (stopping too early).
